    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy garamond bg-white f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>In July 2019, I finally got my hands on James Clear’s Atomic Habits, a book around which there has been much furore. I was excited to read it, yet had a vague premonition that I would absorb the content quickly and forget it just as quickly, as with so many books I’ve read before (think Malcolm Gladwell). I sat comfortably in the library lawns outside Doheny Library at USC on a warm afternoon day and started off.</p>
<p>For a topic such as forming habits and maintaining them, I appreciated that the author provides multiple examples from his own life and that of others. It makes the idea stick. My favourite example from the book was that of the ‘CBE’ system developed by the LA Lakers’ coach, Pat Riley.</p>
<p>I saw a post on LinkedIn by an acquaintance from college, Aman, about how he chose 7 things to focus on each month to create a habit. I was fascinated because I had a failed attempt to do the same in March 2019 - <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yLZ3u4T2CnOcuhVrDAJY5KxrGCsQc9Dkn-ya8VbqNnY/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yLZ3u4T2CnOcuhVrDAJY5KxrGCsQc9Dkn-ya8VbqNnY/edit#gid=0</a></p>
<p>After seeing his post, I tried it myself for the month of May 2019 and stopped after just 12 days.
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dAxUQXRSPrewhRTd5DjhnHfSl6WHbr4DBakb7xILISM/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dAxUQXRSPrewhRTd5DjhnHfSl6WHbr4DBakb7xILISM/edit#gid=0</a></p>
<p>I got in touch with him and I decided to join his shared Google sheet from August 2019.</p>
<p>I’m amazed, proud, and extremely grateful that it’s now been 18 complete months since I stuck with this habit.</p>
<p>Here are my notes: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10bfd71hvK7_4iyAqCwIJ-SGyguHo9xPU/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/10bfd71hvK7_4iyAqCwIJ-SGyguHo9xPU/view</a></p>
<p>How to fail</p>
<p>Why is it so hard to form a habit and stick with it? After reading this book, I realized that the author’s advice to avoid bad habits was actually what I was applying to the habits I was trying to form! I had enthusiasm and the right intentions, but a hopeless approach which set me up for failure. Over time, I’ve realized that an all-or-nothing mindset is quite unhealthy: swinging from 0 productivity to extreme productivity (usually short-lived) over and over is unsatisfying and exhausting. I realized I was actually sabotaging myself through my ‘grand schemes’ by doing the following:
Making the triggers for good habits invisible
Not making them fun and instead feeling like a chore
Making them seem really difficult by aiming to do too much
Not having any reward/punishment system, hence no consequences</p>
<p>What have I been able to do in the past 18 months?</p>
<p>Actually finish this website in January and February
Become reasonably fluent in Spanish through a combination of app flashcards, reading, watching shows, conversing, and logging my Google sheet entries in Spanish for TODO months</p>
<p>Why does this sheet work for me?</p>
<p>Make it obvious: I’ve bookmark this sheet on Windows and Linux on my laptop and it’s always at the top of my most recently opened items on my phone for easy reference.
Make it attractive: I like to customize it further by adding small notes or future plans for the next day, which make me celebrate my accomplishments more, or look forward to future plans.
Make it easy: Updating the sheet for the whole day hardly takes a minute or two.
Make it satisfying: Colour-coding cells is visual and satisfying.</p>
<p>It resonates with my beliefs that:
Accomplishments don’t spring from nothingness, rather they are the result of incremental progress
It’s more important to focus on creating your system to aim for a certain trajectory as opposed to an outcome. As James Clear says, “We don’t rise to the level of our goals, we fall to the level of our systems.”
To be consistent, it’s important to have intermediate rewards and satisfaction rather than stay fixated on a certain outcome. I believe I should reward myself for my effort and work rather than equating only a certain outcome to success. An easy example of this is fitness and nutrition. For a while, I thought I would be content if I reached a certain weight and level of fitness, which I never really defined clearly. Even if I had, I wouldn’t want to constantly criticize myself till I reach this ‘ideal state’ or feel discontent in general. Rather, I want to eat healthy and exercise on a daily basis and derive satisfaction at the end of each day knowing that I’ve taken a slight step in the right direction.
It takes self-awareness to know what your goals are, how much to aim for
It really helps to be part of a community engaging in your ideal behaviour, to keep yourself accountable and motivated looking at others’ progress and cheering each other on.</p>
<p>Evolution of the system</p>
<p>It’s taken so much iteration with this Google sheet to understand myself better in how many things I want to actively try to do, how much of each thing I can do, etc</p>
<p>It’s taught me:
better time management
To be flexible, that my capacity and my priorities should be reassessed every now and then
I can choose to easily create satisfaction by colouring things green</p>
<p>Our group has had people who all want self-improvement and are trying to figure out our own systems to get there - people from India, NL, and the US.</p>
<p>How it’s evolved over time -
Especially during COVID, me and my partners rarely colour things red because we don’t want to constantly berate ourselves
In December 2020, I started thinking of it as a routine to follow in order (starting from morning first actions to a bedtime routine)
From January 2021, I decided to be very clear of my most important priorities and know in which order they matter to me and align my actions accordingly. My sheet has begun to reflect this as well. For the month of February, my priorities are :
My physical and mental health
Putting in the preparation to search for a job
Hobbies, leisure, and socializing</p>
<p>I also started out with an initial target for how many days I should aim to tick something off, but I stopped doing that because I feel guilty/demotivated when I’m not able to meet my targets. Instead, I now recap each week with short notes about how it went and how I felt.</p>
<p>Evolution will keep happening. I still struggle with reducing my screen time, sleeping and waking up punctually, and am still trying to figure out a good way to achieve consistency in the above. As time passes, my priorities will keep shifting and that’s perfectly natural. I have so much room to grow in terms of finding the balance between flexibility to accommodate my changing needs and discipline in following through once I set out to do something. I’m looking forward to maintaining my current habits and adding more!</p>
<p>More than a sheet</p>
<p>I do maintain a detailed journal that I try to write in once every few days and in addition, if I find myself overwhelmed or stressed out, I whip out an A4 sheet and ‘brain dump’ to put it all on paper so I can organize and plan how to get things done and in which order. This Google sheet serves as a quick look-back with tiny notes so I immediately recall how a certain day was. It also really helps alleviate the feeling that time is passing without one being aware or conscious of it and always feeling like time is running out / not being able to remember what happened the previous day / etc. I also like to use it as a sort of calendar to plan to do things.</p>
<p>Figuring out your own system</p>
