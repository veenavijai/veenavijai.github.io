    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy garamond bg-white f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>In July 2019, I finally got my hands on James Clear’s Atomic Habits, a book around which there has been much furore. I had a vague premonition, or rather, a sense of resignation, that I would forget the content just as quickly as I had absorbed it, as has been the case with many books I’ve read before (think Malcolm Gladwell). I sat comfortably on the library lawns outside the Doheny Library at USC on a warm afternoon and started off.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/vv_blog_ah_lib.jpg"/> 
</figure>

<p>The  book dived straight into actionable ideas without much buildup. Overall, it was an engaging read and also fairly economical with words. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10bfd71hvK7_4iyAqCwIJ-SGyguHo9xPU/view">Here&rsquo;s</a> my three-page summary of the book.</p>
<p>For a topic such as habit formation, I appreciated the multiple examples provided by the author from his own life and that of others’ - it made the idea stick. My favourite example from the book was that of the <a href="https://jamesclear.com/career-best-effort">Career Best Effort (CBE) system</a> developed by the LA Lakers’ coach, Pat Riley.</p>
<p>Now, to actually implement it - where to begin?</p>
<h3 id="all-or-usually-nothing">All or (Usually) Nothing</h3>
<p>Too often, I’ve been fired up by the ideal of a ‘complete transformation.’ It’s tantalizing and gratifying to picture myself discarding unconstructive and addictive behaviours overnight (Netflix, staying up late, checking phone notifications), and waking up ruthlessly efficient, effortlessly decisive, and laser-focused. I admit I get carried away. This has happened so many times, right from middle school. I’d chart out a new plan - guaranteed to change my life, of course - on post-it notes, a mind map, or a spreadsheet. After three zealous days, it would prove to be too much. Quietly forgotten, it would only evince guilt and remorse when unearthed months later.</p>
<p>An all-or-nothing mindset is not healthy or sustainable. This is true in many contexts but particularly wrt productivity: repeatedly swinging between the extremes of zero days to hyper-focused days is both unsatisfying and exhausting. Overcommitting and then being unable to live up to my own expectations erodes the trust I have in myself that I will follow through.</p>
<p>I wanted to change this.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-fail-tried-and-tested">How to Fail: Tried and Tested</h3>
<p>Why is it so hard to form a habit and stick with it?</p>
<p>I realized that I had been applying the author’s advice on avoiding <em>bad</em> habits while trying to form <em>good</em> habits! Sure, I had enthusiasm and the right intentions (don’t we all?) but the truth is, I was setting myself up for failure. Here’s an example from March 2019, of how to inevitably fail.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/march.JPG"/> 
</figure>

<p>Plans like the above were ultimately self-sabotage, because I was -</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Not clearly defining a measurable goal</strong> for each day, and <strong>not placing visible triggers</strong> for good habits in my immediate environment</li>
<li><strong>Not making them fun</strong> and instead making it a chore - I felt like I was constantly battling my worst impulses and that quickly gets tiring</li>
<li>Making them seem difficult to achieve consistently by aiming to do <strong>too much, too soon</strong></li>
<li><strong>Not placing consequences</strong> for not doing something</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="from-grand-schemes-to-humble-beginnings">From Grand Schemes to Humble Beginnings</h3>
<p>Before reading the book, I had seen a post about habit creation on LinkedIn by an acquaintance from college, <a href="http://amanadalal.com/">Aman</a>. He chose 7 things to focus on each month and coloured them green or red in a spreadsheet which was shared with other ‘accountability partners.’ I tried it by myself for the month of May 2019 with more reasonable goals. I lasted for a grand total of 12 days.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/may.JPG"/> 
</figure>

<p>Tracking habits consistently is a habit in itself, and one that is all too easy to break. Since the element of accountability was missing, I contacted Aman and joined his shared Google sheet from August 2019.</p>
<p>It’s been 18 months since I began. I’m amazed, proud, and extremely grateful that not only have I stuck with this system, I’ve iterated to make it work for me. I can confidently say that I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abandoned the unrealistic notion of wanting to do everything at once, and instead embraced that I have finite time and energy each day, and I must prioritize</li>
<li>Understood myself better by introspecting each month to figure out these priorities</li>
<li>Actively tried to align my actions with my priorities</li>

<h3 id="eighteen-months-a-lookback">Eighteen Months: A Lookback</h3>
<p>This sheet has kept me company for a majority of my time at graduate school - a demanding and challenging experience which has called for substantial mental fortitude, particularly when half of it took place during a pandemic that no one was prepared for. Indeed, the past 18 months has involved a fair bit of trial and error. Here are some of my biggest accomplishments from this period.</p>
<p><strong>Language learning:</strong> I became reasonably fluent in Spanish in 2019 and 2020 through a combination of app flashcards, reading, watching shows, conversing with people, and logging my Google sheet goals and notes in Spanish for 4-5 months.</p>
<p><strong>Work-related:</strong> I found an internship, lost it because of COVID, and was able to find another one a month before the start date, in the thick of furloughs and layoffs. This sheet helped me consistently reach out to people and keep track of my preparation. When I started, I faced intense FOMO since my internship was entirely virtual. I resolved to meet two new people each week at work. I ended up interacting a fair bit with about thirty colleagues! I gained a ton of perspective from them and it gave me a stronger sense of connection and belonging. I also improved on several aspects of organization + communication by using this sheet: I prepared for morning standup meetings with notes, scheduled time to document my work parallely, placed importance on 1:1 meetings to meaningfully network, and planned the next day’s agenda before sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>Mental health and reflection:</strong> I actively schedule time for self-care and fun: playing guitar, reading, socializing, etc., especially in times of stress. This is a huge change from pre-lockdown. I also take time out to reflect. I’ve been journaling and meditating regularly since September 2020. Over the past 3 months, I’ve been creating and customizing my own vision board for long-term plans. I also have bundles of little lists - things I’m grateful for in my day + things I appreciate in myself. I like to read them when I feel low as a pick-me-up and to remember I always have a lot of good things going for me.</p>
<p><strong>Physical health:</strong> I’ve been reasonably active in 2020 after a year of zero exercise - I’ve been doing yoga, following Youtube workouts, and running. I ran 83 km in January 2020! I now have a skincare routine, which was previously an alien concept to me.</p>
<p><strong>Structure and time management:</strong> I’ve developed a morning routine which I actually look forward to. I’ve limited social media in crucial months for work (now I’ve deleted some and uninstalled all the apps/changed passwords). In my final semester of grad school, I was overwhelmed and struggling to balance about 6-8 commitments at any given point. This sheet helped me prioritize 1-2 tasks for each day, which kept me sane, especially in the final hectic period just before and after graduation.</p>
<p><strong>Time-awareness:</strong> I have increased awareness and appreciation of time, and no longer feel like days pass me by without any sense of control. I’m able to see details of my day without getting lost in them. I can easily recap a whole month since I have an objective and visual record of how I spend my time. In fact, I pulled up the past 18 sheets and made this list fairly quickly!</p>
<p>In a period of extreme uncertainty, I feel more anchored and secure knowing that I have a system in place that I can rely on.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-this-sheet-work-for-me">Why Does this Sheet Work for Me?</h3>
<p>James Clear has four tenets to build good habits: make them obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. Here’s how I follow his principles with respect to defining goals and in habit tracking.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/feb_habits.jpg"/> 
</figure>

<p><strong>1. Make it obvious:</strong> I clearly define what is to be done, for example, ‘Write 3 things I am grateful for,’ ‘2 coding questions,’ ‘read for 10 minutes,’ etc. I’ve kept my good-habit-triggers in plain sight, like my yoga mat, guitar, journal, and running shoes. I’ve bookmarked the spreadsheet on my laptop and phone browsers.</p>
<p><strong>2. Make it attractive:</strong> I like to add small notes to celebrate my accomplishments or look forward to future plans.  In order to feel a sense of achievement early on in the day, I like to get the easy ones out of the way quickly. Having accountability partners also helps in wanting to complete more of my habits, or at least, keep tracking them.</p>
<p><strong>3. Make it easy:</strong> Most goals are the ‘bare minimum.’ Instead of ‘2 hours of coding’ or ‘run 5 km', which is a significant time commitment, I list &lsquo;1 coding question&rsquo; or ‘any workout’ to motivate myself to start, and usually I find I do more if I just start. Also, updating the sheet for the whole day hardly takes a minute or two.</p>
<p><strong>4. Make it satisfying:</strong> Colour-coding cells is visual and super-satisfying! It allows me to glance at a previous week/month and immediately understand what’s going well and what requires more effort. Self-correction becomes natural with colours.</p>
<h3 id="is-this-overkill">Is this Overkill?</h3>
<p>I don’t think so.</p>
<p>Being prone to procrastination and grand plans, I needed a way to measure + execute goals, or risk recollecting them wistfully as ‘having potential.’ To create these realities, measurement or quantification in some form is critical. A non-judgemental and curious mindset to know myself better gives me a perspective of self-discovery and makes the process enjoyable.</p>
<p>This book, along with my experience with the Google sheet, has reinforced certain core beliefs and helped me adopt new ones which serve me well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accomplishments don’t spring from nothingness, rather they are the result of incremental progress.</li>
<li>It’s more important to focus on creating your system to aim for a certain trajectory as opposed to an outcome. As Clear says, “We don’t rise to the level of our goals, we fall to the level of our systems.”</li>
<li>It takes self-awareness to know what your goals are, and how much to aim for. It’s difficult to find the sweet spot of slightly challenging yet achievable.</li>
<li>It helps to be part of a community engaging in my ideal behaviour, to keep myself accountable and motivated.</li>
<li>Intermediate progress and satisfaction are the key to consistency. I believe I should reward myself for my effort rather than equating only a certain outcome to success. Moreover, I don’t enjoy criticizing myself till this ideal outcome is reached (yes, I used to do this): I find that a more constructive approach is to derive satisfaction by taking small steps in the right direction as often as possible, and forgiving myself when I’m unable to.</li>
<li>The aim is never to colour every single cell green - I know I’m not perfect and there will be lapses. It’s more about trying to enact certain priorities to the best of my ability, and aiming to do better the next day. As Clear reinforces in his <a href="https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1">newsletters</a>, “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="evolution-of-the-system">Evolution of the System</h3>
<p>There have been changes in how I approached habit tracking from the time I began, a year and a half ago.</p>
<p><strong>Important vs nice-to-have:</strong> I want to encourage myself more than I berate myself. I only colour cells red if urgent and unfinished, otherwise it’s a neutral grey.</p>
<p><strong>Targets vs notes:</strong> I used to target a number of days per month for each habit. Now I prefer to recap each week with short notes about how it went and how I felt.</p>
<p><strong>Habit stacking:</strong> I grew tired of dazedly stumbling out of bed and starting the day on autopilot, and I’ve used habit stacking to construct a morning routine and add some structure to my day: at least 1 surya namaskara (yoga) + 2 mins nadi shodan (alternate nostril breathing) + drink 0.5L of water + take vitamin supplements + write 3 things I appreciate about myself. This practice helps me feel more grounded in reality, calm, purposeful, and most importantly, hydrated!</p>
<p><strong>Grouping similar habits:</strong> I like to visualize habits category-wise and as of January 2021, in the order of priority. For the month of February, my priorities are #1 My physical and mental health, #2 Putting in the preparation to search for a job, and #3 Hobbies, leisure, and socializing.</p>
<p><strong>Off days:</strong> Each week, I have one ‘off day,’ coloured all-grey, which has zero compulsion to do anything. This offers some respite and gives me time to recharge. I don’t hesitate to move these days around or take more ‘off days’ if my health is affected.</p>
<p>This system is still evolving. Things I’m still working on/would like to do in the future: sleep and wake up punctually, revive my Spanish vocabulary, practise guitar + singing regularly, reduce screen time further. All in good time!</p>
<p>I have so much room to grow in terms of finding the balance between flexibility to accommodate my changing needs and discipline in following through once I set out to do something. I’m looking forward to maintaining my current habits and adding more. I will continue to experiment with my template, and I would encourage you, reader, to find your own system and put this book into practice. Good luck!</p>
